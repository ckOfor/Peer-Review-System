# Peer Review System Smart Contract

## Overview

The Peer Review System is a decentralized smart contract built on the Stacks blockchain that enables developers to submit software packages for review, allows qualified reviewers to provide feedback, and maintains a reputation system for packages.

## Key Features

- Package Submission
- Reviewer Staking Mechanism
- Reputation-based Review System
- Secure Review Submission
- Transparent Package Evaluation

## Contract Functions

### `submit-package`
- **Purpose**: Submit a new software package for review
- **Parameters**:
    - `name`: Package name (up to 64 ASCII characters)
    - `version`: Package version (up to 32 ASCII characters)
- **Returns**: Unique package ID

### `stake-for-review`
- **Purpose**: Stake tokens to become a qualified reviewer
- **Parameters**:
    - `amount`: Number of tokens to stake
- **Requirements**:
    - Minimum stake of 100 tokens to submit reviews

### `submit-review`
- **Purpose**: Submit a review for a specific package
- **Parameters**:
    - `package-id`: ID of the package being reviewed
    - `score`: Review score (0-5)
    - `comment`: Review comment (up to 256 ASCII characters)
- **Requirements**:
    - Reviewer must have minimum stake
    - Score must be between 0-5

### Read-Only Functions
- `get-package`: Retrieve package details
- `get-review`: Retrieve review details
- `get-reviewer-stake`: Check reviewer's staked amount

## Error Codes

- `err-not-found` (u100): Resource not found
- `err-unauthorized` (u101): Unauthorized action
- `err-already-reviewed` (u102): Review already submitted

## Use Cases

1. Developers submit software packages
2. Reviewers stake tokens to gain review privileges
3. Reviewers submit detailed, scored reviews
4. Packages accumulate reputation based on reviews

## Security Measures

- Staking requirement prevents spam
- Score validation
- Ownership and authorization checks
- Transparent review process

## Potential Improvements

- Implement review withdrawal mechanism
- Add more complex reputation calculation
- Create reviewer rating system
- Implement review challenge process

## Example Workflow

```clarity
;; Submit a package
(submit-package "MyAwesomeApp" "1.0.0")

;; Stake tokens to become a reviewer
(stake-for-review u500)

;; Submit a review
(submit-review package-id u4 "Great package, very useful!")
```

## Deployment Considerations

- Ensure sufficient contract balance for staking
- Configure appropriate token transfer mechanisms
- Test thoroughly on testnet before mainnet deployment
